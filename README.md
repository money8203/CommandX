# CommandX

CommandX is a simple command-line interface program implemented in Python. It allows you to navigate directories, open files and applications, perform calculations, and more, all from the command line.

## Features

- **File Operations :** CommandX has a expanded file operation system, allowing you to create, rename, copy/paste, and delete folders & files. These operations can be executed using separate commands for better file/folder management.
- **File Navigation :** Enhancements have been made to the file navigation feature. You can now navigate directly to a specific folder or parent folder using relative paths and special commands.
- **Command Aliases :** With CommandX you can use command aliases to execute different variations of commands. For example, instead of typing `open` you can use `launch` or `start` to achieve the same action.
- **Search the web :** This feature seamlessly conduct web searches by integrating with popular search engine `google`, enabling you to find information, articles, resources, and much more, without leaving the command-line interface.
- **Input Validation :** CommandX includes input validation to handle edge cases and prevent errors. For example, when prompting for a directory name, the tool checks if the directory exists before changing the current directory.
- **Command History Persistence :** CommandX stores the command history in a file, ensuring that your command history is maintained across the session. You can review and access previous commands for reference.
